/**
 * scripts/check-pin-review.mjs is the CI half of the re-pin review gate: bodies
 * are not stored, so a change to what gets served shows up in `git diff` as
 * hashes only, and this is what forces a human attestation anyway.
 *
 * The gate is only worth its comment if it cannot be walked around, so these
 * are the walk-arounds — each one passed some earlier version of the script:
 *   - move the commit (the case it was written for)
 *   - retarget a file inside the SAME pinned commit
 *   - delete a whole source
 *   - revert to a selection the ledger attested to in the past
 *   - satisfy it with 12 hex chars that are not a `sel:` token at all
 *
 * Driven through a throwaway git repo because the check's whole job is to
 * compare a working tree against a base ref.
