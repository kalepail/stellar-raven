/**
 * scripts/diff-pins.mjs is the re-pin REVIEW GATE. Bodies are not vendored, so
 * a re-pin commit shows hash changes only and this diff is the one place the
 * incoming prompt input is ever shown to a human before it starts being served.
 *
 * The property under test is therefore not "it prints a diff" but "no changed
 * or added file's text can reach the served surface without appearing here".
 * A file that is entirely NEW is the case with the most unreviewed text in it,
 * and printing a header for it while skipping its body let an operator follow
 * the documented procedure, see nothing, and truthfully attest to it.
