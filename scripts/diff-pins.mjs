/**
 * diff-pins.mjs — print a unified diff of skill BODIES between two manifests.
 *
 * The review gate for re-pinning. Skill markdown is prompt input, and pinning by
 * hash means a re-pin commit shows only sha changes — the text itself never
 * reaches `git diff` the way it did when bodies were vendored. This fetches both
 * the old and new pinned bytes and prints the actual difference, so the human
 * running `update.sh` sees what the model will start reading.
 *
 * Writes nothing to the repo: the diff is terminal output by design (committing
 * it would re-introduce the vendored copy this design removes).
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/diff-pins.mjs <old-manifest.json> <new-manifest.json>
 * Exit 0 always on success, whether or not anything changed; non-zero only if a
 * pinned file could not be fetched (fail closed — an unreviewable pin is not
 * a reviewed pin).
