 * Deploy preflight — runs as npm `predeploy`, before `wrangler deploy`.

 * `wrangler deploy` bundles the WORKING TREE, not a commit. With several agents
 * committing path-scoped from one shared checkout, the tree is intermittently
 * equal to no commit at all: on 2026-07-30 the root briefly held a local commit
 * with four files reverted, and a deploy in that window would have shipped a
 * partial tree while appearing to ship main. The same shared-tree churn split
 * one change across two commits (9ccfeb4 / b8acfff), leaving main red between
 * them. This refuses to deploy anything that is not exactly the pushed commit.
 *
 * Override with DEPLOY_ALLOW_UNCLEAN=1 for a deliberate off-main deploy.
